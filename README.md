# WordCloud_Python
Implementation of wordcloud library for making cool Images

## Library Required
1. **cv2** - library required for reading images
2. **numpy** - converting images into arrays
3. **wordcloud** - generting beautiful cloud images
4. **matplotlib** - ploting generated images

**install these libraries using either pip or conda**  

## Running the scripts 
I have provided both notebook file and python file 
first install dependencies 

### To run with Python Files
1. open cmd  or bash(linux users)
2. go to that folder in which your python script is saved
3. type python wordcloud.py(windows)     
         python3 wordcloud.py(linux)
4. A beautiful image is generated filled with words
5. you can change the image . Just open the python file in any code editor and give path of your **png** image
6. you  are done . Run the script again using above steps

### To Run with Jupyter Notebook
1. Open jupyter notebook
2. Open .ipynb File in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run that File 
4. A beautiful image is generated filled with words
5. you can change the image . Just open the python file in any code editor and give path of your **png** image
6. you  are done . Run the script again using above steps
